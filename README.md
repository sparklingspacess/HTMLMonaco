# HTMLMonaco
Simple HTML-based Monaco Editor.

Originally made for my IDEs, this is literally just a Monaco HTML Page, there is quite literally nothing special to it.

This was designed for WebView2 only, use with other "web-loaders" may result in issues and/or unknown crashes.

There's no need to credit me for this, seriously, this is literally just a Monaco HTML Page, I am literally just sharing this on GitHub.
